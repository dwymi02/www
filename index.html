            <h1>What's Hacash?</h1>
            <p>A fully designed, fair, open and shared cryptocurrency issuance and circulation standard system for modern financial transaction settlement, business and personal payment services will jointly promote the human economy into an open financial era in the next 100 years.</p>
            <p>Hacash believes that although Bitcoin is revolutionary, it is not perfect, especially its "monetary" aspect has a very large shortcomings. Hacash’s mission is not to subvert and replace Bitcoin technically, but to learn from Bitcoin’s "blockchain" and "computing power issuance currency" technology, using the "Austrian Monetary Economics Theory" as the guiding ideology, focusing on expansion , Improve and complete the system's "monetary" indicators, including BTC to form a complete currency system, and combined with the channel chain settlement network, to promote the large-scale circulation and real-time settlement of encrypted currencies in real personal and commercial payments.</p>
            <p>Hacash's "monetary nature" is reflected in: 1. The most fair and market-oriented currency issuance mechanism; 2. Three different energy levels and heterogeneous commodity currencies: Diamond, BTC(transferred), HAC; 3. Channel chain settlement Real-time settlement of large-scale payments through the network; 4. Rich and risk-free conditional payment agreements and multi-party signing contracts to adapt to modern commercial payment circulation; 5. Optional features such as privacy protection, anti-calculation power attacks, and flexible third-party financial services.</p>
            <p>If Bitcoin is compared to the original and revolutionary C language in the field of programming languages, then Hacash's mission is to become C++.</p>

            <h5>A truly open and shared operating mode</h5>
            <p>There is no so-called "official" that controls most of the benefits and decision-making power. It is truly decentralized, and all codes and algorithms (including nodes, wallets, and browsers) are all open source. The development of the project relies on the free dedication of early development contributors and the support of the consensus community. Everyone is a contributor and a beneficiary at the same time.</p>

            <h5>The fairest currency issuance algorithm</h5>
            <p>There is no founder reward, no official holding, no node distribution, no pre-mining, no private placement, no foundation. Everything starts fair mining from scratch. It took 6 years to increase the reward per block from 1 to 8, and then it took 60 years to decrease to 1, and finally fixed at one currency per block. A total of 22 million were mined in 66 years.</p>

            <h5>Equity level control and multi-signature account system</h5>
            <p>Multi-signature accounts solve the security problems of lost and stolen secret keys and the need for simple co-trust of funds. There is also an account system that can meet the multi-level equity investment structure of modern enterprises (supporting the difference between beneficial rights and voting rights, and avoiding extreme capital loss).</p>

            <h5>On-demand multiple privacy protection without efficiency loss</h5>
            <p>Generally, privacy-focused currencies either greatly sacrifice transaction efficiency, or need to be kept online insecure, or the operations are complicated and inconvenient to use, or both. Hacash provides multiple privacy protection functions such as payment mixing, pre-deferred payment, encrypted settlement network, etc., which can be customized on demand without losing payment efficiency and ease of use.</p>

            <p class="p">The X16RS mining algorithm invented by Hacash randomly uses 16 hash algorithms of the sha3 series, which can resist the emergence of ASIC mining machines. At present, the best solution is to use computer CPU for bookkeeping and mining. In the initial stage, the reward currency will be more widely dispersed in the hands of individuals, reducing or avoiding the concentration of a large number of currencies in the hands of a small number of people, so as to avoid price manipulation and maliciousness. Issues such as hype.</p>
            <p class="p">Everyone is welcome to use idle desktop PCs or laptops for accounting and mining in exchange for currency rewards. The hosts provided by cloud service providers can also be purchased to become stable miners and mining pool nodes to collect packaged transactions and contribute to the popularization of the entire network.</p>

            <p class="p">The <span class="val">supervene</span> parameter indicates how many threads are enabled for mining at the same time. Generally, it is consistent with the number of CPU cores of your computer, which can maximize the computing power. For example, if the number of CPU cores in your computer is 2 cores, change <span class="val">supervene: 8</span> to <span class="val">supervene: 2</span>, if it is 4 cores, change to <span class="val">supervene: 4</span>, and so on. At this time, the computer CPU utilization rate is 100%. In order to avoid computer freezing, it is generally recommended to set aside a core for other calculations: 4 cores are set to 3, and 8 cores are set to 7. You can also set it freely according to your situation. The smaller the value, the lower the CPU utilization. This value does not support decimals, the minimum is 1, and it is not recommended to set it to a value larger than the number of computer CPU cores.</p>

            <p class="p">The string value of the <span class="val">rewards</span> parameter is the Hacash account address, which is used to collect currency rewards generated by mining. This address must be generated by a password and has a specific format. It is invalid to modify the patched address manually!

            <p class="p">The above-mentioned full node mining needs to synchronize all block data, and has high requirements for the stability of the network environment (otherwise, it is easy to break the network and branch). If you do not have a more professional hardware environment and network operation and maintenance knowledge, or do not have a strong CPU performance computing machine, using the full node mining method will encounter some unnecessary trouble, or it is difficult to get the mining out.</p>
            <p class="p">We suggest that small-scale mining participants join the mining pool, so as to avoid a lot of trouble in data and network operation and maintenance. In addition, through the average computing power statistical method, we can more definitely and evenly distribute the mining results, and smooth out the fluctuation of computing power and the element of luck.</p>

            <h1 class="pgtt">3、Construction of mine pool service</h1>
            <p class="p">Technically speaking, the mining pool is a mining node, but the mining operation is assigned to many other computing machines, and they communicate with each other through network connection. In other words, a pool is a full node whose functions are divided into different machines for execution.</p>
            <p class="p">Building a mine pool is also very simple. First of all, you need to prepare a server with an external fixed IP address (the configuration depends on the size of the business), then <a class="dld" href="#minernode">build a mining full node</a> according to the above method, and wait for all block data to be synchronized.</p>

            <p class="p">Then open the configuration file <span class="val">hacash.config.ini</span> , enable the enable field under the <span class="val">[minerpool]</span> key（Enable by deleting the semicolon before the enable field）：</p>
            <p class="p">
                <img class="cutwrap lazy" data-src="/image/tobeminer/pool_worker_config.png" />
            </p>
            <p class="p">Close and restart the full node, the mining pool program will start the service, you can open a statistical computing power data connection to view the statistics of the mining power added to the mining pool：<a class="dld" target="_blank" href="http://182.92.163.225:3340">http://182.92.163.225:3340</a>，Where <span class="val">182.92.163.225</span> is the external IP of your server.

            <h1 class="pgtt">4、Mining block diamonds</h1>
            <p class="p">Block diamonds are another heterogeneous and indivisible currency on the Hacash network. For details, please refer to: <a class="dld" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hacash/paper/blob/master/draft/whitepaper.cn.md#5-%E5%8C%BA%E5%9D%97%E9%92%BB%E7%9F%B3">What's block diamonds</a> and <a class="dld" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hacash/paper/blob/master/draft/whitepaper.cn.md#3-%E9%92%BB%E7%9F%B3%E9%87%87%E6%8E%98">Diamond mining algorithm</a>.</p>
            <p class="p">Block diamond mining can only be produced by full-node SOLO mining at present. After deploying <a href="#minernode">full-node mining</a> and synchronizing all block data, modify the configuration file To the following:</p>
            <p class="p">
                <img class="cutwrap lazy" data-src="/image/tobeminer/diamond_miner_config_ini.png" />
            </p>
            <p class="p">Configuration <span class="val">supervene</span> is the number of concurrent threads for multi-threaded parallel mining, which has the same meaning as the supervene parameter for HAC coin mining; <span class="val" The >fee_amount</span> parameter is the default fee bid amount set for the mined diamonds. If multiple diamonds are mined in a block at the same time, the diamond with the highest fee price will be packaged into the block and the whole network If the confirmation is valid, other diamonds in the same period will be considered invalid and discarded. Everyone starts to mine the next diamond from the beginning; <span class="val">fee_password</span> is the password of the account address that paid the fee for bidding Or private key (must ensure that the account has the balance set by fee_amount, so that the mined diamonds can be packaged into effect); the address set by the <span class="val">rewards</span> parameter is the reward address after the diamond is mined. That is, the attribution address of the newly mined diamond. <span class="val">continued</span> means whether to mined a diamond after mined out a diamond. This will lead to the possibility of mined out more than one diamond in a cycle. You can choose the diamond you think is more valuable to make a higher bid.</p>

            <p class="p">Through the <a class="dld" target="_blank" href="http://block.hacash.org/">block explorer</a> you can view the current cycle in real time The bidding ranking of all the diamonds unearthed. [Note: In a period (5 blocks), only the only diamond ranked first in the handling fee will be packaged, and other diamonds will be directly discarded]. If you need to increase the ranking to the first place, you can reset the corresponding in <a class="dld" target="_blank" href="https://wallet.hacash.org/">online wallet</a> Diamond handling fee. (The result of diamond mining is that a special transaction is packed into a block height that can be divisible by 5. The transaction fee for ranking after diamond mining is the transaction fee)</p>

            <p class="p">After starting the process of mining diamonds, the prints should be as follows:</p>
            <p class="p">
                <img class="cutwrap lazy" data-src="/image/tobeminer/diamond_mining_status.png" />
            </p>

            <p class="p">By setting the parameter of <span class="val">autobid = true</span>, the program of digging out diamonds can be bid automatically. Among them, <span class="val">fee_ amount = ㄜ1:247</span> means the first bid for digging out diamonds. Then, every 10 seconds, the program automatically checks the diamond bid of the current highest bid. If the bid is higher than my bid, the parameter autobid will be used <span class="val">autobid_fee_margin = ㄜ 2:247</span> is the step value of bid, and the price higher than the highest diamond bid will be automatically issued, so as to keep the highest bid of diamond excavated by oneself. Parameter <span class="val">autobid_fee_max = ㄜ 10:248</span> is the upper limit that I will issue for each diamond, which means that if other people bid more than this price, I will stop bidding and will not quote a higher price.</p>

            <p class="p">[special attention] automatic bidding does not guarantee that you will get diamonds. For example, the following situations occur: 1. Diamonds are mined out late at the end of the cycle, and other diamonds with the highest current price have already been packed into the block before the first bid; 2. The diamonds of others are packed just in the interval of 10 seconds' automatic bid; 3 Network synchronization is stuck and your program doesn't get other people's bid. If you want to get the diamond as much as possible, please try to optimize the following contents: 1. Upgrade to a more stable network (with better links but not more bandwidth); 2. Issue higher initial bid and bidding step value as much as possible, so as to surpass the highest bidding value set by others after a few automatic bidding, so as to defeat others. 3.Please do not set too small step value of bid (autobid_fee_margin), If the bid change is too small, it will be lower than the accuracy that can be recognized by the system, so you can't change your bidding order.</p>
